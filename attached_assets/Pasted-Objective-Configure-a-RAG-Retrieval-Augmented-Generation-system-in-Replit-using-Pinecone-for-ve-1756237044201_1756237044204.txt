Objective:
 Configure a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system in Replit using Pinecone for vector storage to ensure:
Persistent storage of embeddings and document metadata across restarts.


No duplication of documents or embeddings in Pinecone.


Minimized hallucinations by grounding answers only in indexed documents.


Accurate contract review using uploaded documents and global best practices.


Requirements:
Use Pinecone Starter Plan API key (already stored in Replit Secrets).


Create and initialize a single Pinecone index for all contract embeddings.


Automatically deduplicate chunks based on a hash of the content before inserting.


Store these fields in Pinecone metadata for each chunk:


doc_id → Unique ID for the source document.


chunk_id → Sequential ID for the chunk.


jurisdiction → Country/region if specified.


contract_type → NDA, MSA, lease, etc.


source_url or uploaded_by if available.


Ensure embeddings use OpenAI’s text-embedding-3-large model for better context quality.


On retrieval, fetch only top N (e.g. 5) most relevant chunks and pass them into the model.


Responses must stay within retrieved context and must cite source doc_id and chunk_id.


If no relevant information is found, the response should explicitly say:
 "I couldn’t find enough information in the uploaded documents to answer this accurately."


Configure a deduplication guard:


Before inserting, compare new embeddings with existing embeddings using cosine similarity (>0.97 = duplicate → skip insert).


Include a fallback to global best practices documents when no local matching chunks are found.


Testing Checklist:
✅ Upload multiple documents of the same type and confirm no duplicate embeddings are created.


✅ Restart the app in Replit → confirm embeddings persist.


✅ Query an unseen contract → confirm RAG retrieves closest matches only.


✅ Validate the assistant avoids hallucinations and cites sources.


✅ Test with documents from different jurisdictions → ensure responses indicate applicable regions.
