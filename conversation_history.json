It serves as a framework for the relationship and can cover various aspects such as payment terms, confidentiality, liability, and dispute resolution. The MSA simplifies the process for future agreements by establishing a common understanding, which can save time and reduce negotiation efforts for individual projects.\n\n\ud83d\udccb For detailed analysis:\n\u2022 Upload contract documents\n\u2022 Ask specific legal questions",

MSAs may have a defined term, such as one year, or they may remain in effect until terminated by either party, often with a notice period specified in the agreement. It's important to review the specific language in the MSA to understand its duration and any renewal provisions that may apply.\n\n\ud83d\udccb For detailed analysis:\n\u2022 Upload contract documents\n\u2022 Ask specific legal questions",
